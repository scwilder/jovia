<h1>Welcome to my Cybersecurity Page!</h1>
<h2>Who am I?</h2>
<p>Hi! My name is Jovia Wilder and I am a 9th grade student at RHS. As a student in a cybersecurity class, it's my job to keep other users of mobile devices and the internet safe. </p>


<p>As technology becomes an everyday use as a part of our lives, understanding cybersecurity is crucial. My website aims to help users like you to become safer on your devices.</p>

<h2>What is Cybersecurity?</h2>
<p>Cybersecurity involves protecting digital systems, networks, and data from unauthorized access, attacks, and breaches. Itâ€™s like a digital fortress that shields us from online threats like malware and phishing scams.</p>
