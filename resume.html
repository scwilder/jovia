<h1>Classes</h1>
<p>While I haven’t taken many classes on the subject of cybersecurity, here are some of the coding related subjects I took:

Computer Applications
Computer Applications, or Computer Apps, was a class I took in 6th grade which taught students the basics of how games are created and how to create them. We crafted simple games like Pong and other time-challenged games like “tap the circle on the screen before the next one appears,” things like that. Games that are attention consuming but still easy to code. This class taught me the first rules of coding.  

Introduction to Programming
Introduction to Programming, aka Intro to Programming, was a class I took in 7th grade. This class was similar to Computer Apps in which we would program games and mini movies in Scratch. I successfully made many different games and mini-movies with different goals and plots. This class taught me how to program using sites like Scratch.</p>
